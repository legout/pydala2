# Basic Dataset Operations

This example demonstrates the fundamental operations you can perform with PyDala2 datasets, including creation, data manipulation, and basic querying.

## What You'll Learn

- Creating different types of datasets
- Basic data operations (filter, select, aggregate)
- Working with metadata
- Dataset persistence

## Files

- `basic_operations.py` - Python script demonstrating basic dataset operations
- `basic_operations.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook version
- `basic_operations.py` - Marimo notebook version (converted from Jupyter)

## Running the Examples

### Python Script
```bash
cd basic-dataset-operations
python basic_operations.py
```

### Jupyter Notebook
```bash
cd basic-dataset-operations
jupyter notebook basic_operations.ipynb
```

### Marimo Notebook
```bash
cd basic-dataset-operations
marimo edit basic_operations.py
```

## Prerequisites

- PyDala2 installed (`pip install pydala2`)
- Sample data files (will be created by the examples)

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

1. **Dataset Creation**: How to create datasets from various sources
2. **Data Manipulation**: Basic operations like filtering and selection
3. **Metadata Handling**: Working with dataset metadata
4. **Persistence**: Saving and loading datasets
